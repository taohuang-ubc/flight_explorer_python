# Introduction

Flight safety is often an important issue. Airlines are financially affected by plane malfunctions, since travellers often will pick an airline based on its record of safety, and a particularly bad incident will leave a bad reputation, regardless of improvements. In addition, various agencies would like to collect data about air safety, in order to discover any trends or patterns involved with air accidents.
